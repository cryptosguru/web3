NaughtCoin is a play on words. It's an ERC20 compliant token for ether-_naut_ and the worth of these tokens after you hack them, _naught_. You hold all of the tokens, but you'll only be able to transfer them after a 10 year lockout period. Can you figure out how to get your hands on them before the lockout period finishes?
