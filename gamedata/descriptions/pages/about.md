### The Comic
Ethernaut is named after "El Eternauta", an illustrious Argentine comic written by the journalist Héctor Germán Oesterheld. The story is about a multi-race worldwide alien invasion, as seen from the perspective of a family in Buenos Aires. In the first few hours of the invasion, a strange snowfall exterminates most life on the plantet. See [El Eternauta Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternaut) for more info.
